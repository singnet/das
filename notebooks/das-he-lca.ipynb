    "# Link Creation Agent\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of the **Link Creation Agent (LCA)** in `hyperon-experimental` to generate expressions (links) using pattern-matching queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **DAS Link Creation Agent (LCA)** generates new expressions (links) within a knowledge base by processing queries through **templates** or specialized **processors**. Together, these components define an **LCA Request**.   \n",
    "An LCA Request can be executed a specified number of times or configured to run indefinitely, with the goal of continuously updating the database with relevant links over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each execution of an LCA Request is referred to as a **request cycle**. During a cycle, LCA performs a pattern-matching query, retrieves all matching results, and then applies the specified template or processor to transform these query answers into new expressions. The generated links/expressions are inserted back into the knowledge base, potentially influencing subsequent cycles. This iterative process enables the system to dynamically evolve its internal structure as new relationships are discovered and added over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **query parameters** control the behavior of the query component within the LCA Request. They can define the context, determine how importance values are updated, limit the number of returned query answers, or restrict results based on importance value.  \n",
    "Additionally, the overall execution behavior of the LCA Request can be configured through parameters such as the **repeat count**, which determines how many times the request should run, an **interval** (in seconds) can also be defined to specify the delay between consecutive executions of the LCA Request.\n",
    "\n",
    "For full DAS documentation check [here](https://github.com/singnet/das), and more LCA documentation [here](https://github.com/singnet/das/tree/master/src/agents/link_creation_agent)\n",

    "**Before running this notebook, execute the [setup procedure/notebook](https://github.com/singnet/das/blob/master/notebooks/das-he-setup.ipynb) to load the [animal_dataset](https://github.com/singnet/das/blob/master/src/tests/integration/cpp/data/animal_expressions.metta).**"

In future versions, LCA will also support user-defined processors implemented directly in MeTTa, allowing advanced users to prototype and integrate custom processing logic without modifying the core system.\n",
