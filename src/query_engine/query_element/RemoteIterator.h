 * A special case of QueryElement because RemoteIterator is not actually an element of the
 * query tree itself but rather a utility class used to remotely connect to the sink of a query
 * tree (RemoteSink).
 *
 * Basically, the goal of this class is to allow a caller to request a query execution remotely
 * and iterate through the results using the RemoteIterator.
 *
 * NB Like Iterator in this same package, this is not a std::iterator as the behavior we'd expect
 * of a std::iterator doesn't fit well with the asynchronous nature of QueryElement processing.
 * Instead, this class provides only two methods: one to pop and return the next
 * query answers and another to check if more answers can still be expected.
