/**
 * Wrapper to thread objects to externelly (outside the thread method/function) make it stop.
 * As side effect, we can also check if the thread has already been stopped.
 *
 * To use StoppableThread:
 *
 * (1) Create a shared_ptr<StoppableThread> object passing an ID string (this id is used in logging
 * messages). The idea is that this ID is unique but this is not actually required in the scope of
 *     StoppableThread. Uniqueness, however, is useful in scenarios where we have multiple
 *     threads running the same method/function and we need to distiguinsh among them (either in
 *     the logs or in the code that controls the threads).
 * (2) Make the thread method/function (i.e. the method/function which will be executed by the
 *     thread) expect a shared_ptr<StoppableThread> object as argument. Inside the thread
 *     method/function, use stopped() to control if the thread is supposed to abort execution.
 *     It's OK if the method/function reaches the end without stopped() being trigered. The idea
 *     of the Stoppable interface is to allow "aborting" behavior.
 * (3) After creating the StoppedThread object as described in (1), call attach() passing the std::thread
 *     object.
 * (4) Outside the thread method/function, use stop() to make the thread stop, join and be deleted.
 * Joining and deletion are optional. Use stop(false) to skip them.
