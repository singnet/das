/**
 * Data abstraction of an asymmetric Hebbian Network with only direct hebbian links.
 *
 * A Hebbian Network, in the context of AttentionBrokerServer, is a directed graph with
 * weights in the edges A->B representing the probability of B being present in a DAS
 * query answer given that A is present. In other words, provided that the atom A is one of
 * the atoms returned in a given query in DAS, the weight of the edge A->B in
 * a HebbianNetwork is an estimate of the probability of B being present in the same answer.
 *
 * HebbianNetwork is asymmetric, meaning that the weight of A->B can be different from the
 * weight of B->A.
 *
 * All edges in HebbianNetwork are "direct" hebbian links meaning that they estimate the
 * probability of B BEING present in a answer given that A is. There are no "reverse"
 * hebbian links which would mean the probability of B being NOT present in an answer
 * given that A is.
 *
 * HebbianNetwork keeps nodes in a HandleTrie which is basically a data structure to map
 * from handle to a value object (mostly like a hashmap but slightly more efficient because
 * it makes the assumption that the key is a handle). So in the stored value object it stores
 * another HandleTrie to keep track of the neighbors. So we have two types of value objects,
 * one to represent Nodes and another one to represent Edges.
