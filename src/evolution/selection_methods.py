Module for selecting individuals based on fitness.

This module implements two selection methods:
  - best_fitness: Selects individuals with the highest fitness values.
  - fitness_proportionate: Selects individuals proportionally to their fitness (roulette wheel).

It also provides a function to retrieve the appropriate selection function based on a specified method.
